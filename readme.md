## Components

MAde with Javascript, Css and HTML.

## Challenges and process.

Some javascript issues i didn't know why they weren't working and I ddin't know hwy they didn't work.
However, while doing the project I learned more about programming and the importnace of always making sure your email is  registered for the api call or else it won't work!

But through careful reasearch methods Donny taught me (looking up repos on github then using them as a guide) I managed to make this project work out better! Except for the damn wind object which for some reason wasn't covered or discussed in ANY of the repos so I had to figure it out on my own. And it only toook 3 hours to do.

and ya know what the funniest part was? I could've saved all the time doing something else but no just that.
